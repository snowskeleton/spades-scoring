# Shall We Play a Game?

This program is designed to facilitate the easy scoring of a game of Spades.

Features of note:

  * Simple methods. Each method does one thing
  * SQL; specifically, SQLite. This not only allows for logging of the game for later perusal, but also ties into the next point
  * Able to recover from failure. Did your terminal die in the middle of a game? Simply pass in a flag, and you'll pick up right where you left off
  * Thoughtful UI. Careful consideration was put in to how the information is being displayed on screen.
